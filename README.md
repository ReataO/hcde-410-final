# hcde-410-final - Exploring Food Accessibility Disparities in King County 
## Overview 
This project investigates disparities in food accessibility across King County, focusing on racial and income-related inequities. It aims to understand how demographic factors and income levels correlate with food insecurity and access to supermarkets. The study hopes to inform polices and community initiatives to promote equitable food access. 
### Key components:
**Research questions:**
- Do BIPOC communities face disproportionately low food accessibility compared to predominantly White communities?
- How does distance from supermarkets correlate with income-related disparities in food accessibility?
**Hypotheses:**
- BIPOC communities face disproportionately low food accessibility compared to White communities.
- Greater distances from supermarkets exacerbate income-related disparities in food accessibility.

## Methodology
1. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify relationships between variables.
   - Highlighted the relationships between food access metrics and demographic factors.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Summarized data distributions to understand key patterns and trends.

3. **Data Visualizations**  
   - Created scatterplots to illustrate relationships between specific variables.
   - Annotated visualizations with correlation coefficients to aid interpretation.

4. **Narrative Summary**  
   - Documented key findings, limitations, and implications of the study.
