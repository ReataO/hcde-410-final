This project examines the impact of food deserts—areas with limited access to affordable, nutritious food—on chronic health conditions. Using the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, I aim to analyze how geographic disparities in food access contribute to health inequities and inform targeted intervention policies for vulnerable communities. This project will focus on the broad research question: How do geographic, socioeconomic, and demographic factors influence food accessibility in the United States? To address this question, I will use a range of analytical methods, including correlation analysis and descriptive statistics, to explore patterns in the data. Findings will be presented through data visualizations, such as bar charts and scatter plots, along with a narrative summary to contextualize and interpret the results.
