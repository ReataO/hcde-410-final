# A4: Final project preliminary proposal

#### Motivation and problem statement
For this project, I want to explore the increasing awareness of the health disparities linked to geographic location and how limited access to healthy food options impacts chronic health outcomes. These geographical locations that have access to healthy food options are called food deserts. These food deserts are urban and rural areas where affordable and nutritious foods are difficult to access. It has been concluded that food deserts are a significant factor in the prevalence of chronic health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and morbid obesity. With adverse health effects on a person's quality of life, examining how food deserts influence health outcomes is essential, especially for those of a lower socioeconomic status. 
I hope to learn the relationship between geographical location and the prevalence of food deserts, which cause massive disparities. This project aims to understand these links, contribute to efforts for health justice, and inform police to target the most vulnerable areas. 

#### Data selected for analysis 
The data I plan to use to conduct this analysis is the Food Access Research Atlas dataset provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); this data is available [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/ 
). This dataset provides comprehensive information on food access across the United States. It details areas with low access to food, their income levels, and the distance from the nearest grocery store. This data also provides demographic data on top of geographic data that can be useful in contextualizing the distribution of food deserts and the people who are affected by them.
The data set included information about areas with limited access to supermarkets, areas with low income, the distance to the nearest grocery store, vehicle access, and demographic indicators. It is publicly available and accessible. The dataset provides essential metrics to draw mini-full conclusions about those affected by food deserts.   

#### Unknowns and dependencies
In order to complete this project may involve challenges beyond my control. While the USDA data provides information on food access and demographic metrics, one limitation is the lack of direct health data.  Health data could enhance the analysis of food deserts’ impact on health outcomes. However, accessing additional health datasets may require authorization that I don’t have due to data privacy. For that reason, I am changing my project goal slightly. Therefore, I am refining my project’s focus: instead of assessing health outcomes directly, I will identify the demographic groups most at risk of adverse health effects due to living in food deserts

# A5: Final Project Plan

## Overview and Research Questions
### Overview:
This project examines how food access across the United States affects different socioeconomic statuses and demographics. It will focus on the role of race, age, and socioeconomic status in determining these groups' accessibility to healthy, nutritious foods. While doing research, many studies suggest that food deserts disproportionately affect marginalized communities leading to health disparities such as chronic illnesses. This project explores how demographic factors, such as income, race, and age influence food access. Gain a better understanding of the relationship between demographic factors and low food access. 

### Research Questions:
1. How do demographic factors, such as income, race, and age, affect food access?
2. Does an increase in distance to local food markets correlate with decreased food access?
3. How do racial demographics affect food accessibility in urban vs rural areas?
4. How does vehicle access affect food accessibility across different demographics?

### Hypotheses:
- BIPOC communities face disproportionately low food accessibility compared to predominantly white communities.
- Households with limited or no vehicle access experience significantly reduced food accessibility. 
- Low population density is associated with decreased food accessibility in rural areas.
- Greater distances from supermarkets or grocery stores correlate strongly with reduced food accessibility
- Communities with a higher percentage of elderly residents are more likely to have limited food accessibility

## Background and Related Work
Previous research has shown that food deserts are prevalent in neighborhoods with high poverty rates and with a significant minority population. Studies highlight that limited access to fresh, nutritious foods in food deserts exacerbates health disparities leading to high rates of obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses. 
- **[Evaluating Consumer Nutrition Environment in Food Deserts and Food Swamps](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7967537/)**: This article examines the barriers to food access, particularly in low-income urban neighborhoods, highlighting that a lack of supermarkets and fresh food sources is linked to poorer health outcome
- **[Food Accessibility, Insecurity and Health Outcomes](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/resources/understanding-health-disparities/food-accessibility-insecurity-and-health-outcomes.html)**: Links food accessibility and insecurity to health disparities, showing that food deserts and low food accessibility lead to poorer health outcomes.
- **[Neighborhood Disparities in Access to Healthy Foods and Their Effects on Environmental Justice](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3482049/)**: Analyzes the role of social and environmental factors in food deserts, finding that socioeconomic status, transportation, and community resources are critical in shaping access to healthy foods.
- **[The Intersection of Neighborhood Racial Segregation, Poverty, and Urbanicity and its Impact on Food Store Availability in the United States](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3970577/)**: Concludes that poor predominantly black neighborhoods face a double jeopardy with the most limited access to quality food.

The background research supports the focus on demographic factors as a significant contributor to food access disparities. This project aims to add to existing research by examining demographic variables and their roles in food accessibility. 

## Methodology

### Data Sources:
The primary data source is the USDA’s Food Access Research Atlas dataset, which includes geographic and demographic information about food access, income levels, distance to the nearest supermarket, and vehicle access. It is publicly available on the USDA’s website as a downloadable Excel file.

### Analytical Methods:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Used to identify and understand the relationships between demographic variables (race, age, income) and food accessibility metrics. This will analyze the correlation between these two factors in the data set.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: o summarize key demographic variables (income, race, age) and food accessibility metrics (density of community, distance to the nearest supermarket), and identify patterns, trends, and relationships within data. This will provide a structured way to interpret and understand the dataset. 

### Presentation Methods:
- **Data Visualizations**: Use bar charts, dot plots, and graphs to illustrate the distribution of food accessibility across different demographic groups. This provides a clear way to understate the information in the dataset by showing trends and patterns. 

- **Narrative Summary**:A written evaluation of the statistical findings to provide context for the results. This method will explain the dataset and provide indices and implications of my project's findings and the dataset's significance in addressing food access.
